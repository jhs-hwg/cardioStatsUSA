See Details description group variable stratify variable. time_variable [character(1)] name time variable. default, svy_year, corresponds variable nhanes_data indicates 2 year NHANES cycle observation collected . time_values [character(1+)] time values included design object. default include time values present data. Valid options : 'most_recent': includes recent time value. 'last_5': includes 5 recent time values. '': includes time values present data. can also give vector specific time values, e.g., c(\"2009-2010\", \"2011-2012\", \"2013-2014\"), values present time_variable column (nhanes_data). pool [logical(1)] FALSE (default), results presented individual times, separately. TRUE, data time value pooled together. Note contiguous cycles pooled together, e.g., using pool = TRUE time_values = 'last_5' okay, using pool = TRUE time_values = c(\"2009-2010\", \"2013-2014\") recommended (strange result interpret). subset_calls [named list(n)] names subset_calls variable names, values values variable include subsetted data. example, subset_calls = list(\"demo_gender\" = \"Women\") subset data include rows demo_gender equal \"Women\". Multiple entries allowed collapsed logical & operator. example, subset_calls = list(demo_gender = \"Women\", bp_med_use = \"Yes\") subset data include rows demo_gender equal 'Women' bp_med_use equal \"Yes\" standard_variable [character(1)] name variable used create standardization groups. default use demo_age_cat, leads age standardization. standard_weights [numeric(n)] proportionate weights group defined standard variable. number weights equal number groups defined standard_variable weights must >0. statistic_primary [character(1)] statistic defines geometric objects plot. statistics featured text appears users mouse hovers corresponding object. title [character(1)] title appear plot. supplied, title generated using key data x. geom [character(1)] type figure made. Valid options : 'bar' creates bar plot annotations bars 'point' creates scatter plot 95% confidence interval error bars reorder_cats [logical(1)] whether re-order categorical group variable levels shown increasing order expected outcome. width [numeric(1)] width plot, pixels height [numeric(1)] height plot, pixels size_point [numeric(1)] size points plot.
